Over the last two weekends I built myself a standing desk. It was fun and pretty
straightforward. Here are some notes on the process. If it's useful context, I
used the following tools:

- A screwdriver + screws
- Sandpaper
- Measuring tape
- An electric drill
- A hand saw + mitre box, which guides the saw blade to help you make 90° cuts
- A set square, for measuring 90° angles
- A circular saw, which I used to cut the table top down

TODO: mention limited tools etc

## Dimensions

The tabletop is 90 x 61cm, and it's made of 18mm plywood. I was originally
aiming for 90 x 50cm, the size of the desk I had previously. I scaled it up
because I had a piece of leftover plywood which was 61cm wide and this meant I
only needed to make one cut.

The table legs are 100cm. I worked this out experimentally, measuring a height
that felt comfortable when I was standing, taking into account the extra height
the tabletop and my keyboard add.

## Basic design

The basic structure is inspired by the Grid Beam[^1] system which I first read
about a few years ago. Grid Beam talks about a three beam joint they call a
'tri-joint', which is strong, and crucially doesn't require any proper joinery
to make.

The table is mostly made of 34 x 34mm planed pine, which was readily available
at a local store, and didn't require any processing apart from some light
sanding and cutting to length.

The four table legs are connected to each other with tri-joints.

## Bracing

Each pair of adjacent table legs form a square, which is susceptible to
deforming into a parallelogram, which makes the table wobbly. To fix this, you
add cross bracing, which

## Misc learnings

    [Grid Beam](https://gridbeam.xyz/guide/) is a modular system for building
    things from re-usable beams of wood, with holes drilled in them at regular
    intervals. The beams can be bolted together a bit like furniture-sized
    Meccano.
