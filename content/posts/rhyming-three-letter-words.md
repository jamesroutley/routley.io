I was thinking about rhyming three letter English words (e.g. sat/set/sit), and
was wondering if there were any groups where all five vowels were represented. I
wrote some code to find them.

## Word list

To find rhyming sets, I needed a list of words. I ended up using a JSON-encoded
version of Webster's English dictionary I
[found on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewreagan/WebstersEnglishDictionary/blob/5e42283f9d1c3437921471f2c2ccea446e4c5e41/dictionary.json).
The repo mentions that the JSON file was built using a 2009 version of the
dictionary with some known omissions, but I figured it would be good enough.

My first attempt at this used a
[list of the 25k most popular words](https://github.com/dolph/dictionary/blob/c65f04b0b5b27a981f437b940cf62fe71320d5ec/popular.txt),
but I found this contained a lot of three letter abbreviations (e.g. ads, bio,
cos).

## Rhyming sets

My code found the following rhyming sets (you can click on words to see their
definitions):

- [`bag`](#bag), [`beg`](#beg), [`big`](#big), [`bog`](#bog), [`bug`](#bug)
- [`ban`](#ban), [`ben`](#ben), [`bin`](#bin), [`bon`](#bon), [`bun`](#bun)
- [`bat`](#bat), [`bet`](#bet), [`bit`](#bit), [`bot`](#bot), [`but`](#but)
- [`dan`](#dan), [`den`](#den), [`din`](#din), [`don`](#don), [`dun`](#dun)
- [`fan`](#fan), [`fen`](#fen), [`fin`](#fin), [`fon`](#fon), [`fun`](#fun)
- [`far`](#far), [`fer`](#fer), [`fir`](#fir), [`for`](#for), [`fur`](#fur)
- [`gat`](#gat), [`get`](#get), [`git`](#git), [`got`](#got), [`gut`](#gut)
- [`jag`](#jag), [`jeg`](#jeg), [`jig`](#jig), [`jog`](#jog), [`jug`](#jug)
- [`lag`](#lag), [`leg`](#leg), [`lig`](#lig), [`log`](#log), [`lug`](#lug)
- [`nab`](#nab), [`neb`](#neb), [`nib`](#nib), [`nob`](#nob), [`nub`](#nub)
- [`nat`](#nat), [`net`](#net), [`nit`](#nit), [`not`](#not), [`nut`](#nut)
- [`pat`](#pat), [`pet`](#pet), [`pit`](#pit), [`pot`](#pot), [`put`](#put)
- [`rad`](#rad), [`red`](#red), [`rid`](#rid), [`rod`](#rod), [`rud`](#rud)
- [`rat`](#rat), [`ret`](#ret), [`rit`](#rit), [`rot`](#rot), [`rut`](#rut)
- [`tag`](#tag), [`teg`](#teg), [`tig`](#tig), [`tog`](#tog), [`tug`](#tug)
- [`tan`](#tan), [`ten`](#ten), [`tin`](#tin), [`ton`](#ton), [`tun`](#tun)

Reading through these, there are some which scrape through using old archaic
words. Let's order the sets in terms of how valid they seem.

### 1. Obviously correct - children would understand all words

- [`bag`](#bag), [`beg`](#beg), [`big`](#big), [`bog`](#bog), [`bug`](#bug)
- [`pat`](#pat), [`pet`](#pet), [`pit`](#pit), [`pot`](#pot), [`put`](#put)

### 2. Correct, but uses words I needed to look up

- [`dan`](#dan), [`den`](#den), [`din`](#din), [`don`](#don), [`dun`](#dun).
  "Dan" is an imported Japanese word for a level of Karate proficiency. "Dun" is
  a "dull greyish-brown colour".
- [`tan`](#tan), [`ten`](#ten), [`tin`](#tin), [`ton`](#ton), [`tun`](#tun).
  "Tun" is brewing term for a cask of wine or beer.

### 3. Correct, but uses very modern words

- [`bat`](#bat), [`bet`](#bet), [`bit`](#bit), [`bot`](#bot), [`but`](#but).
  This uses "bot" (e.g. a "Twitter bot"). It'll be interesting to see if the
  word is still in popular usage in a few years or decades.
- [`gat`](#gat), [`get`](#get), [`git`](#git), [`got`](#got), [`gut`](#gut).
  "Gat" as in the slang for a gun. "Git" is English slang for an unpleasant
  person.

### 4. Uses alternate or archaic spellings of modern words

- [`ban`](#ban), [`ben`](#ben), [`bin`](#bin), [`bon`](#bon), [`bun`](#bun)
- [`fan`](#fan), [`fen`](#fen), [`fin`](#fin), [`fon`](#fon), [`fun`](#fun)
- [`far`](#far), [`fer`](#fer), [`fir`](#fir), [`for`](#for), [`fur`](#fur)
- [`jag`](#jag), [`jeg`](#jeg), [`jig`](#jig), [`jog`](#jog), [`jug`](#jug)
- [`lag`](#lag), [`leg`](#leg), [`lig`](#lig), [`log`](#log), [`lug`](#lug)
- [`nab`](#nab), [`neb`](#neb), [`nib`](#nib), [`nob`](#nob), [`nub`](#nub)
- [`nat`](#nat), [`net`](#net), [`nit`](#nit), [`not`](#not), [`nut`](#nut)
- [`rad`](#rad), [`red`](#red), [`rid`](#rid), [`rod`](#rod), [`rud`](#rud)
- [`rat`](#rat), [`ret`](#ret), [`rit`](#rit), [`rot`](#rot), [`rut`](#rut)
- [`tag`](#tag), [`teg`](#teg), [`tig`](#tig), [`tog`](#tog), [`tug`](#tug)

## Commentary

- I was surprised that I only found two sets of obviously correct sets.
- The other side of the same coin - I was surprised by how many pronounceable
  three letter words aren't real words. By comparison, short domain names are
  desirable, and there is an organic mechanism that English words shorted (e.g.
  _God-be-with-you_ to _goodbye_, _fourteen-night_ to _fortnight_).

<dt id=beg>beg</dt>
<dd>A title of honor in Turkey and in some other parts of the East; a bey.<br><br>1. To ask earnestly for; to entreat or supplicate for; to beseech. I do beg your good will in this case. Shak. [Joseph] begged the body of Jesus. Matt. xxvii. 58. Note: Sometimes implying deferential and respectful, rather than earnest, asking; as, I beg your pardon; I beg leave to disagree with you. 2.

Syn. -- To Beg, Ask, Request. To ask (not in the sense of inquiring) is the generic term which embraces all these words. To request is only a polite mode of asking. To beg, in its original sense, was to ask with earnestness, and implied submission, or at least deference. At present, however, in polite life, beg has dropped its original meaning, and has taken the place of both ask and request, on the ground of its expressing more of deference and respect. Thus, we beg a person's acceptance of a present; we beg him to favor us with his company; a tradesman begs to announce the arrival of new goods, etc. Crabb remarks that, according to present usage, "we can never talk of asking a person's acceptance of a thing, or of asking him to do us a favor." This can be more truly said of usage in England than in America.<br><br>To ask alms or charity, especially to ask habitually by the wayside or from house to house; to live by asking alms. I can not dig; to beg I am ashamed. Luke xvi. 3.</dd>

These conjunctions mark opposition in passing from one thought or topic to another. But marks the opposition with a medium degree of strength; as, this is not winter, but it is almost as cold; he requested my assistance, but I shall not aid him at present. However is weaker, and throws the opposition (as it were) into the background; as, this is not winter; it is, however, almost as cold; he required my assistance; at present, however, I shall not afford him aid. The plan, however, is still under consideration, and may yet be adopted. Still is stronger than but, and marks the opposition more emphatically; as, your arguments are weighty; still they do not convince me. See Except, However.

LG. log, lock, Dan. log, Sw. logg.] (Naut.)  An apparatus for measuring the rate of a ship's motion through the water. Note: The common log consists of the log-chip, or logship, often exclusively called the log, and the log line, the former being commonly a thin wooden quadrant of five or six inches radius, loaded with lead on the arc to make it float with the point up. It is attached to the log line by cords from each corner. This line is divided into equal spaces, called knots, each bearing the same proportion to a mile that half a minute does to an hour. The line is wound on a reel which is so held as to let it run off freely. When the log is thrown, the log-chip is kept by the water from being drawn forward, and the speed of the ship is shown by the number of knots run out in half a minute. There are improved logs, consisting of a piece of mechanism which, being towed astern, shows the distance actually gone through by the ship, by means of the revolutions of a fly, which are registered on a dial plate. 3.
