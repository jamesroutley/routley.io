      <title>Home server and Pi-hole</title>

      <description>I recently bought a small (10 by 10cm), cheap (~£100) computer to use as a home server. It&amp;rsquo;s got 4GB of RAM and 60GB of disk, so not very powerful, but not terrible either. I got it to get some experience with classical system administration. At work everything is containerised and runs in Kubernetes, so I don&amp;rsquo;t actually have much experience managing linux servers the traditional way.
Operating system I installed Ubuntu Server 18.</description>

      <description>This website runs as a static site hosted on GitHub pages. I don&amp;rsquo;t currently have any way of telling how many people are reading it, or what pages they&amp;rsquo;re reading etc.
The simple way to get this data would be to add Google Analytics to the website. However, I think it&amp;rsquo;s an interesting exercise to work out how to implement something similar ourselves. This would let us specify the amount of information we&amp;rsquo;d like to log about each visitor and we&amp;rsquo;d also have control of the data ourselves, rather than shipping it to a third party.</description>

      <description>Yesterday, I wrote about how this website looks small on Firefox on mobile. It turns out, this is a viewport issue, which is fixed by adding the following line to each page&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lt;head&amp;gt;:
&amp;lt;meta name=&amp;#34;viewport&amp;#34; content=&amp;#34;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&amp;#34; /&amp;gt; What&amp;rsquo;s going on? A browser&amp;rsquo;s viewport is the area of the page which can currently be seen.
When smartphones were first introduced, most web pages weren&amp;rsquo;t optimised for mobile and would have looked broken when viewed from mobile devices, because mobiles have much smaller viewports than desktop browsers.</description>

      <description>article img { max-width: 350px; }  This website is currently rendered with very small text in Firefox on mobile. Here&amp;rsquo;s a screenshot of what it looks like on a Pixel 2:
While debugging this, I tried removing all CSS from my website. It turns out that the issue isn&amp;rsquo;t to do with anything I&amp;rsquo;ve written (I think), but the way Firefox displays unstyled HTML on mobile:
I&amp;rsquo;m a bit surprised by this - I would have assumed that rendering unstyled HTML would be legible in any browser.</description>

      <description>There are a couple of different file formats that e-books are distributed in. The one I most commonly see is the EPUB format, which has the .epub file extension. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the internals of this file this format.
An example EPUB In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll be looking at a copy of Moby Dick, published by the website Planet Ebook. You can download the EPUB from this page.</description>

      <guid>http://routley.io/posts/gratitude-journal/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how I&amp;rsquo;d design a gratitude journal product. A gratitude journal lets you keep a record of things you&amp;rsquo;re grateful for. Proponents say gratitude journaling offers a number of mental health benefits.
Why build a product?  Habit building. One of the common issues with starting a gratitude journal is developing the habit of writing consistently. Products can help develop habits by reminding users to write. There&amp;rsquo;s a dark side to habit building products, so we&amp;rsquo;d want to stay away from being too intrusive.</description>

      <title>mmv, a tool for batch renaming files</title>

      <description>A couple of months a go, I wrote a command-line tool called mmv, which lets you batch rename files. You can find its source code on GitHub.
mmv takes a single argument, a path to a directory. It opens a list of the files in that directory in the text editor of your choice. You can edit the file names and when you save and exit your editor, it&amp;rsquo;ll rename the files.</description>

      <description>This February, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write a blog post every day. I&amp;rsquo;m now a week in - how are things going?
Positives:
 I&amp;rsquo;m finding it easier coming up with things to write about. I&amp;rsquo;ve started noting down interesting things I come across through my day as potential blog posts. I feel more comfortable writing shorter posts, which has opened up the range of topics I&amp;rsquo;m happy to write about. I&amp;rsquo;m having fun!</description>

      <description>I just implemented breadcrumb navigation for this blog. How it works is quite neat - we iterate over the sections of the path, and store our current position using a Hugo Scratch variable:
&amp;lt;nav&amp;gt; &amp;lt;ul&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- Initialise a scratch variable &amp;#34;path&amp;#34; to an empty string --&amp;gt; {{ $.Scratch.Set &amp;#34;path&amp;#34; &amp;#34;&amp;#34; }} &amp;lt;li&amp;gt;&amp;lt;a href=&amp;#34;/&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Home&amp;lt;/a&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/li&amp;gt; &amp;lt;!-- For each non-empty item in the URL path --&amp;gt; {{ range $element := split .RelPermalink &amp;#34;/&amp;#34; }}{{ if ne $element &amp;#34;&amp;#34; }} &amp;lt;!</description>

      <description>I was digging through Vim&amp;rsquo;s documentation, and came across the help article diff.txt. It turns out that Vim implements a visual diff feature, which shows the &amp;lsquo;difference between two to eight versions of the same file&amp;rsquo;.
I occasionally need to find the differences between two files, and have historically used diff for this. Unfortunately, I find the output quite hard to parse:
$ diff file_1 file_2 32c32 &amp;lt; TODO: screenshot of diff --- &amp;gt; !</description>

      <description>There are certain command line tasks I need to do every few weeks or months, which is infrequently enough that I need to look up the syntax every time I do them. For example:
 Undoing a commit Getting ripgrep to return only the text which matches a regular expression, not the whole line Executing a command against all files in a directory  A solution To save time searching for how to do these things, I decided to create my own command line tool, cookbook, which would let me save examples (or &amp;lsquo;recipes&amp;rsquo;) for these tasks.</description>

      <description>This post covers how I currently make coffee at home. I&amp;rsquo;ll update it if anything changes
Aeropress Equipment:
 Porlex hand grinder (I have the &amp;lsquo;tall&amp;rsquo; version) Aeropress Weighing scale Timer  Technique:
 Grind 15g coffee to a medium grind (7-8 &amp;lsquo;clicks&amp;rsquo; from closed on the Porlex) Insert the Aeropress plunger into the main body, to the &amp;lsquo;4&amp;rsquo; mark. Place the Aeropress upside down onto a weighing scale, so the end of the plunger is on the scale, and the open end of the main body is facing up Place the filter paper into the lid of the Aeropress, and wash it through with water, boil about 400g of water Add the coffee to the Aeropress, tare the scale, Add 200g of water just off the boil, start the timer, add the rest of the water to your cup to heat it up After about 20 seconds, a crust of coffee grounds will form at the top of the Aeropress.</description>

      <description>Some issues with todo lists Todo lists store a number of tasks, but don&amp;rsquo;t offer any advice on which order to tackle the tasks in. This system works well - it&amp;rsquo;s simple, and people are generally pretty good at quickly working out what to work on next. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed a couple of issues with the system:
 When there are lots of tasks, working out the next task can be complicated.</description>

      <description>Over the month of February, I&amp;rsquo;m going to try and write a blog post each day. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping that this high cadence will have a couple of benefits:
 I&amp;rsquo;ll get back into the habit of writing I&amp;rsquo;ll learn to write faster The act of writing every day will help my focus my thoughts, and I&amp;rsquo;ll end up having ideas or insights I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have had otherwise  I expect the format of my posts to change, to become shorter and less fleshed out, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s fine for now.</description>

In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m building an ls clone. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty similar to the last post&amp;rsquo;s pwd clone. It&amp;rsquo;s called rls.
Code use std::env; use std::fs; use std::process; fn main() { let args: Vec&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; = env::args().collect(); if args.len() != 2 { usage(); } let directory = &amp;amp;args[1]; let paths = fs::read_dir(directory).</description>

      <description>Over summer, I attended the Recurse Center. I noticed that around half the people in my batch were using Vim, and figured it would be a good time to try it out. I ran into two difficulties:
 I knew the basics of using Vim but I was less efficient than with my previous editor, Visual Studio Code I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to configure Vim to use the syntax highlighting, indentation and linters I was used to.</description>

We&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to:
 Write binary DNS query messages Send our message as the body of a UDP datagram using Python Read the response from the DNS server  Writing binary sounds difficult, but I actually found it quite approachable.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the engineering practice of keeping a logbook, and show how it can be applied to programming work.
Logbooks I studied engineering at university. Part of my course involved practical work, which we recorded in a logbook. To use a logbook successfully, you have to:
 Consider the problem you&amp;rsquo;re attempting to solve Describe your method for solving it Describe the process of carrying out the method Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved  This process is well suited to problem solving and active learning, and is described by George Pólya in his book How to Solve It, which describes a method for solving mathematical problems.</description>

Parallelisation Golang tests can be easily parallelised by calling t.Parallel() at the beginning of a test:
func TestThing(t *testing.T) { t.Parallel() // test code } This test will now be run in parallel with other tests marked as parallel. Parallel tests are run in a number of goroutines.</description>

While I don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s possible to learn a programming language in a week, I think there&amp;rsquo;s value in broadening your horizons with the quick study of a wide range of concepts.
This post summarises my initial thoughts about Elm, and lists some resources which may help you learn it.</description>

      <description>This post explores an elegant method for implementing undo/redo functionality in text editors.
Problem We wish to implement functionality that allows the user of a text editor to undo their last action. If they accidentally undo an action, we want to let them redo it.
For the purposes of this post, let&amp;rsquo;s assume that a text editor makes edits to a text object. This text object is an array of string pointers1, with each string representing a line of text2.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been implementing data structures in C. Writing C is fun and educational, because it&amp;rsquo;s lower level than most other common languages. It&amp;rsquo;s fast, and writing it teaches you to understand what&amp;rsquo;s happening at a machine level.
However, C is also relatively difficult to write, making it harder to analyse and test. It would be helpful to be able to do this with a higher level language, such as Python.</description>

      <description>Parameterisation is a technique which makes testing simpler, more concise and more effective. It does this by separating test logic from test data. Let&amp;rsquo;s consider a test for a simple function, and how it can be improved by parameterisation.
Simple test Let&amp;rsquo;s test the following function:
# prime.py import math def is_prime(x): &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; is_prime returns True or False indicating whether x is prime or not. &amp;#34;&amp;#34;&amp;#34; if x &amp;lt;= 1: return False for i in range(2, int(math.</description>

      <title>PSA: cp -r behaves differently on linux and macOS</title>
      <link>http://routley.io/posts/psa-cp-recursive/</link>

      <description>Today I found out (the hard way) that the GNU (available on linux) and BSD (available on macOS) implementations of cp behave differently when used to recursively copy.
The differing behaviour comes when running cp with the -r flag on a source directory that ends with a slash (/):
 GNU/linux: copy the whole directory BSD/macOS: copy the contents of the directory  While this is documented behaviour (see man pages below), it can lead to unwanted behaviour if you develop on a mac and build on a linux-based CI system.</description>

      <title>Simplify Golang test fixtures with this one weird trick</title>

      <description>When testing code, test functions may depend on some external dependency. For example, if we have written a:
 Web crawler, we may want to test it on a real website Web server, we may want to test GET methods against a real database  Test fixtures are functions which launch the external dependencies our test code requires.
Say we&amp;rsquo;re writing a web crawler and want to test it against a real website.</description>

      <description>This article walks through writing a spell-checking algorithm, making use of a neat data structure called a trie, which is particularly suited to the problem.
We will look at:
 The spell-checking problem and naive solutions What a trie is and how it can offer us a better solution The trie-based solution Analysis of our solution How our solution can be improved Other problems that can be solved with tries  Problem We wish to write a spell-checking algorithm which should return a boolean indicating whether the word might be valid or not.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been writing a Forth interpreter in x86 assembly. As my laptop runs masOS, I&amp;rsquo;m using an Ubuntu virtual machine to compile and run my code. I&amp;rsquo;m using Vagrant to manage the VM.
I experienced an issue with Make:
$ make clean make: Warning: File &amp;#39;Makefile&amp;#39; has modification time 1153 s in the future rm -f forth forth.o make: warning: Clock skew detected. Your build may be incomplete. This turned out to be an issue with clock drift on the VM.</description>

      <description>One of my objectives while I&amp;rsquo;m at the Recurse Center is to improve my knowedge of securing computer systems. A good way of learning this is to play an attacker and to try to break into insecure systems1. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through Natas, a &amp;lsquo;wargame&amp;rsquo; developed by Over The Wire. Natas is a series of insecure webapps, which aim to teach the basics of web security.
This post covers solutions to the first twenty levels of Natas.</description>

      <description>Over the weekend, Recurse Center held a game jam. Over 72 hours, I built a phyics game named Slingshot. In the game, you play the pilot of a spaceship with little fuel. To survive, you must navigate around planets and neutron stars to reach a series of checkpoints. You can play Slingshot here, and view the source code here.
This post describes how the game is implemented.

      <title>Tail recursion for imperative programmers</title>

      <description>At the Recurse Center, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working my way through The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) book. It&amp;rsquo;s an introductory programming book written for an MIT course in 1985. It teaches programming using the language Scheme, a LISP dialect. Scheme is functional, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying learning new functional concepts.
This article aims to explain tail recursion to programmers without experience in functional languages or concepts.
Before looking at tail recursion, let&amp;rsquo;s look at recursion in an imperative language, Python.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently started at the Recurse Center (RC), a self-directed, three-month coding program based in New York. The main objective of the course is to improve as a programmer, but the way that&amp;rsquo;s gone about is left up to the individual. Having the opportunity to build anything for an extended period of time in an encouraging and nurturing environment is a privillage offered to few, and it&amp;rsquo;s important to make the most of it.</description>

      <description>Previous Hosting and Deployment Previously, the website was hosted using GitHub Pages, a free static website hosting provided by GitHub. Once Pages is configured, the updated site can be deployed by pushing it to GitHub with git push.
The old website used the Jekyll static site generator. As Jekyll is written by GitHub, GitHub Pages also natively supports Jekyll sites, running the build step for you.
S3 Website Hosting AWS S3 can be configured to host static websites.</description>

      <description>Old Website The old website&amp;rsquo;s CSS was based on Bootstrap, with some custom styling. Source code can be found here. The code itself was hacked together.
The font is Josefin Slab, which I quite liked for the main page, but I thought it felt too affected for use as the main font for blog posts.
There are issues with the font size of the monospace font used for code blocks.</description>
