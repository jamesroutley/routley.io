  <p>In this post, I&rsquo;ll describe the engineering practice of keeping a logbook, and
show how it can be applied to programming work.</p>
<h2 id="logbooks">Logbooks</h2>
<p>I studied engineering at university. Part of my course involved practical work,
which we recorded in a logbook. To use a logbook successfully, you have to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Consider the problem you&rsquo;re attempting to solve</li>
<li>Describe your method for solving it</li>
<li>Describe the process of carrying out the method</li>
<li>Record what happened, and ask how it could be improved</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is well suited to problem solving and active learning, and is
described by George PÃ³lya in his book
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It">How to Solve It</a>, which
describes a method for solving mathematical problems.</p>
<h2 id="logbooks-for-programming">Logbooks for programming</h2>
<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been trying to apply this method to writing software and
debugging code. It requires more upfront work than jumping in and trying things
out, but it offers some advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides a framework for solving hard problems by encouraging you to break
them down into a series of smaller ones.</li>
<li>It helps you focus on the task at hand by providing immediate context on what
you&rsquo;re doing. If you forget or become distracted, you can quickly get back to
your train of thought.</li>
<li>It helps you learn quickly. You can observe your method for problem solving,
see what works and what doesn&rsquo;t and make improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping a logbook has been a useful and interesting process for me so far - I&rsquo;d
encourage you to try it out.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Real engineering logbooks are professional records which can be used as legal
evidence in case of patent disputes etc. They must be bound so pages can&rsquo;t be
inserted or removed, written in ink, each page must be dated, and each new day&rsquo;s
work must start on a new page.</p>
<p>Our logbook doesn&rsquo;t need to be this formal. Mine is a collection of Markdown
files each titled with today&rsquo;s date. I store them all in the directory
<code>~/logbook</code>. To simplify this, I&rsquo;ve added a shell function for quickly opening
today&rsquo;s entry in Vim:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="color:#00f">function</span> lb() {
    vim ~/logbook/<span style="color:#00f">$(</span>date <span style="color:#a31515">&#39;+%Y-%m-%d&#39;</span><span style="color:#00f">)</span>.md
}
</code></pre></div><p>Although it&rsquo;s simple enough to be added as an <code>alias</code>, I&rsquo;d recommend using the
function. The function re-evaluates <code>date</code> each time its run, while the alias
only evaluates it when your <code>bashrc</code> or <code>zshrc</code> is evaluated. If you leave a
shell open overnight, <code>lb</code> will open yesterday&rsquo;s page.</p>
