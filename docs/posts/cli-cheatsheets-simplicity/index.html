<p>There are certain command line tasks I need to do every few weeks or months,
which is infrequently enough that I need to look up the syntax every time I do
them. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Undoing a commit</li>
<li>Getting <code>ripgrep</code> to return only the text which matches a regular expression,
not the whole line</li>
<li>Executing a command against all files in a directory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>

<p>To save time searching for how to do these things, I decided to create my own
command line tool, <code>cookbook</code>, which would let me save examples (or &lsquo;recipes&rsquo;)
for these tasks. I wrote this in Python, and it&rsquo;s about 70 lines of code with
whitespace and comments. Because I wanted it to be simple, it shells out to
other programs if it needs to do anything complicated. For example, the <code>edit</code>
command just opens a file in Vim.</p>

<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

<p>My <code>cookbook</code> tool worked well, until it didn&rsquo;t. I ran into several issues:</p>

<ol>
<li>The <code>cookbook</code> script wouldn&rsquo;t be in my <code>$PATH</code>, so the command wouldn&rsquo;t work</li>
<li>I&rsquo;d try and run it on a computer which didn&rsquo;t have Python 3 installed</li>
<li><code>cookbook</code> stores examples for each tool in a separate file. You search for
examples using the name of the tool, but some tools could plausibly be
indexed by multiple names. For example, <code>ripgrep</code> is known by both <code>ripgrep</code>
and <code>rg</code>. I use <code>neovim</code> as my text editor, and I could never remember if I&rsquo;d
stored examples under <code>neovim</code>, <code>nvim</code> or <code>vim</code></li>
</ol>

<p>By definition, these issues would crop up when I was trying to do something
else, so I&rsquo;d work around them, rather than fixing them.</p>

<h2 id="real-vs-perceived-simplicity">Real vs perceived simplicity</h2>

<p>Over time, I realised that the real problem was with my entire approach. I&rsquo;d
tricked myself into thinking that my solution was simple because the code I&rsquo;d
written was simple.</p>

<p>In retrospect, it&rsquo;s obvious that my initial approach was too complex. I fell
into a trap which is easy to fall into as a programmer. When you learn to code,
a world of automation, improved productivity and control opens up to you, and
every problem becomes solvable by writing a script or a command line tool.
Writing this code feels good, but it&rsquo;s important to remember that while lots of
problems can be solved by writing code, they&rsquo;re not always best solved by
writing code.</p>

<h2 id="a-simpler-solution">A simpler solution</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve since switched to storing these examples in a single file, which I search
through with <code>grep</code>, and edit with Vim. There&rsquo;s no custom code involved.</p>
