<p>The <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">Pico-8</a> is a &lsquo;fantasy console&rsquo; built
by Lexaloffle. It&rsquo;s a program that runs on your computer that lets you write an
play small games written in Lua. I recently implemented Conway&rsquo;s Game of Life
for Pico-8 and it was a fun and rewarding experience. You can play with my
implementation
<a href="https://routley.io/projects/pico-8-game-of-life/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>This post contains some thoughts I had while making the game.</p>

<h2 id="lua">Lua</h2>

<p>This was my first time writing Lua and found it easy to pick up. It&rsquo;s similar to
other scripting languages, including Python, which I&rsquo;ve written extensively. I
like that Lua&rsquo;s fundamental data type is the hash table - they&rsquo;re useful for a
large number of problems.</p>

<h2 id="pico-8-standard-library-isn-t-lua-s-standard-library">Pico-8 standard library isn&rsquo;t Lua&rsquo;s standard library</h2>

<p>This tripped me up a bit - I&rsquo;d get something working using Stack Overflow
answers and the Lua REPL to find that it wouldn&rsquo;t work in Pico-8. This
<a href="https://gist.github.com/josefnpat/bfe4aaa5bbb44f572cd0">GitHub Gist</a> outlines
the discrepancies.</p>

<h2 id="performance-matters">Performance matters</h2>

<p>The Pico-8 runtime is CPU and memory restricted. This means the algorithmic
complexity of your game update function actually matters. My initial, naive,
Game of Life implementation ran in <code>O(n^2)</code> time, where <code>n^2</code> is the number of
pixels on the board. This was too slow to run smoothly, so I had to rewrite it,
and ended up with a <code>O(m)</code> implementation, where <code>m</code> is the number of &lsquo;alive&rsquo;
pixels on the board. Usually, <code>m &lt;&lt; n^2</code>.</p>

<p>I round this limited runtime fun to work with. Most code I write is
performance-limited by network latency, so its algorithmic complexity doesn&rsquo;t
matter as much. It was rewarding to <em>have</em> to write fast code.</p>

<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>You can access live Memory and CPU usage with the builtin <code>stat</code> function. I
used this to print out debug information when trying to get my frame rate high
enough:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#f0f0f0;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-lua" data-lang="lua"><span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">-- debug printing</span>
debug <span style="color:#666">=</span> <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">false</span>

<span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">function</span> <span style="color:#06287e">_draw</span>()
    <span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">-- ...</span>
    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">if</span> debug <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">then</span>
            print(stat(<span style="color:#40a070">0</span>))
            <span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">-- you want this to be below than 1. Greater than 1 means you&#39;re</span>
            <span style="color:#60a0b0;font-style:italic">-- dropping frames</span>
            print(stat(<span style="color:#40a070">1</span>))
    <span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">end</span>
<span style="color:#007020;font-weight:bold">end</span></code></pre></div>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>Pico-8 is cute, fun platform to develop for. The challenges you face are
different to those faced in day-to-day programming, and I&rsquo;d recommend having a
go at it!</p>
