  <p>I was digging through Vim&rsquo;s documentation, and came across the help article
<code>diff.txt</code>. It turns out that Vim implements a visual diff feature, which shows
the &lsquo;difference between two to eight versions of the same file&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I occasionally need to find the differences between two files, and have
historically used <code>diff</code> for this. Unfortunately, I find the output quite hard
to parse:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">$ diff file_1 file_2

</code></pre></div><p>Vim&rsquo;s visual diff is much clearer to me:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">$ vim -d file_1 file_2
</code></pre></div><p><img src="/img/posts/vim-diff/diff.png" alt="Image showing what a diff looks like in Vim"></p>
<p>Vim sets some options to make browsing the diff easier:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>scrollbind</code> is set to <code>on</code>, so when you scroll through one file, the other
will scroll alongside it</li>
<li>Sections of common text are hidden with a fold</li>
</ol>
<p>There are commands for jumping between diffs, and copying text from one file to
the other. You can find out more by typing <code>:help diff.txt</code> from inside Vim.</p>
