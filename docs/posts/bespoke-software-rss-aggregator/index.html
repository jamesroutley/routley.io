    <h1>Bespoke software, and a really simple RSS aggregator</h1>
    <time datetime="2020-05-25">25 May 2020</time>

  <p>This week I built myself an RSS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> aggregator<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. There are a
couple of websites that are written by friends, or are of high enough quality
that I want to read everything published on them, not just the things that are
popular enough make their way to me via Hacker News or similar.</p>
<p>I had fun building it, and I think its design is interesting, so let&rsquo;s take a
look at how it works. I&rsquo;ll also use it as an example to talk about the sort of
bespoke software that I&rsquo;ve really been enjoying writing recently.</p>
<h2 id="how-the-rss-aggregator-works">How the RSS aggregator works</h2>
<p><img src="/img/posts/bespoke-software-rss-aggregator/screenshot.png" alt="web page displaying a list of links"></p>
<p>This is what it looks like. It&rsquo;s a webpage, hosted at
<a href="https://news.routley.io/">news.routley.io</a>, which contains links to the last 30
days worth of posts from each of the blogs I subscribe to.</p>
<p>The website and the code which generates it are stored in a single
<a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/news.routley.io">GitHub repo</a>, and it works by
gluing together a couple of GitHub features.</p>
<h3 id="generating-the-web-page">Generating the web page</h3>
<p>I wrote a simple
<a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/news.routley.io/blob/master/main.go">Go script</a>,
which stores a list of RSS feeds I subscribe to. When the script is run, it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Iterates over the feeds, fetches the list of posts from each one, and stores
them in a big list of all posts</li>
<li>Uses Go&rsquo;s HTML templating package to generate a self-contained HTML page
containing the list of posts</li>
<li>Saves this HTML page as a file in the repo, at <code>docs/index.html</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="serving-the-webpage">Serving the webpage</h3>
<p>Github Pages is enabled for the repo. It serves the contents of the <code>docs</code>
directory (which just contains the <code>index.html</code> file) on my custom domain
<a href="https://news.routley.io/">news.routley.io</a>.</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-webpage">Updating the webpage</h3>
<p>I created a
<a href="https://github.com/jamesroutley/news.routley.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-website.yml">GitHub Action</a>
which:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pulls the repo</li>
<li>Runs the Go script to generate the website</li>
<li>Commits any changes to <code>index.html</code>, and pushes them back to the repo</li>
</ol>
<p>This action is triggered by a cron, and runs every hour. When the updated
<code>index.html</code> is pushed to the repo, GitHub Pages automatically updates the
website.</p>
<h2 id="bespoke-software">Bespoke software</h2>
<p>Historically, I would have built this as a CLI tool, so other people could use
it to generate their own RSS aggregators. This adds a number of things I&rsquo;d need
to think about. For example I&rsquo;d need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define a way to let people specify feeds to pull posts from. This would
probably be a config file with a pre-defined syntax, which we&rsquo;d need to read
and parse.</li>
<li>Let the user specify the name of the file to output HTML to in case they don&rsquo;t
want to use GitHub Pages.</li>
<li>Let users specify their own CSS, rather than hard coding it into the HTML
template.</li>
<li>Store the code which generates the RSS aggregator to be in a separate repo
from the repo which stores and serves my RSS aggregator, so users can clone or
fork it without getting things specific to my aggregator.</li>
<li>Update the script to read multiple feeds concurrently, so it remains fast for
users who subscribe to large numbers of feeds.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these are particularly difficult to add, but each adds to the total
complexity of the project. In my day job as a software engineer, I write a lot
of code which is &lsquo;used&rsquo; by other people - sometimes directly, but also
indirectly when they read it, make changes to it and keep it running in
production. Writing code that other people use requires extra work. Sometimes
it&rsquo;s nice to step back from it and write code that&rsquo;s just for yourself.</p>
<p>(By the way - if enjoyed this post and would like to follow me, I&rsquo;ve also got an
<a href="/posts/index.xml">RSS feed</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> stands for &lsquo;Really Simple
Syndication&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s a protocol that lets websites list their content in a
machine-readable format. Applications can read RSS feeds to pull content
from multiple websites into one place.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

<p>I call it an &lsquo;RSS aggregator&rsquo; rather than the more common &lsquo;RSS
reader&rsquo; because mine doesn&rsquo;t let you read any of the content directly - it
just links out to the source webpages.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
