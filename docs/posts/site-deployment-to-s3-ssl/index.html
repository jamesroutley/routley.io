  <h2 id="previous-hosting-and-deployment">Previous Hosting and Deployment</h2>
<p>Previously, the website was hosted using
<a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, a free static website hosting
provided by GitHub. Once Pages is configured, the updated site can be deployed
by pushing it to GitHub with <code>git push</code>.</p>
<p>The old website used the Jekyll static site generator. As Jekyll is written by
GitHub, GitHub Pages also natively supports Jekyll sites, running the build step
for you.</p>
<h2 id="s3-website-hosting">S3 Website Hosting</h2>
<p>AWS S3 can be
<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html">configured</a>
to host static websites. As the Jekyll build process produces a static website,
this static site can be hosted on S3. This requires an extra build step; with
GitHub Pages the Jekyll build was managed by GitHub, on S3 it needs to be run
manually. The website is deployed by uploading it to S3.</p>
<p>These two steps can be automated using the following <code>Make</code> process:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-make" data-lang="make">build:  <span style="color:#008000"># Create the static and store it in _site/
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>	jekyll build

deploy-prod: build  <span style="color:#008000"># Deploy the production website to S3
</span><span style="color:#008000"></span>	aws s3 sync _site s3://jamesroutley.co.uk --delete
</code></pre></div><p>They deployment uses the AWS <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">CLI</a>, which must be
correctly
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html">configured</a>
with AWS credentials for the destination account.</p>
<p>A development environment was set up at
<a href="https://dev.jamesroutley.co.uk/">dev.jamesroutley.co.uk</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dns">DNS</h2>
<p>S3 static websites are assigned a URL, such as
<a href="http://jamesroutley.co.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/">http://jamesroutley.co.uk.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/</a>.
To access the website from a custom domain name, a Route53 Alias Record pointing
the custom domain name to the S3 bucket
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/website-hosting-custom-domain-walkthrough.html">should be created</a>.</p>
<h2 id="ssl">SSL</h2>
<p>While S3 can be used to host static websites, it doesn&rsquo;t natively support SSL.
To set it up, a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">CloudFront</a> distribution
must be created. CloudFront is AWS&rsquo;s content delivery network (CDN), a
geographically distributed network of servers used to deliver web content. CDNs
are usually used to speed up web response times and reduce server load.
CloudFront is used in this case because it supports SSL. To set it up, this
<a href="https://blog.webinista.com/2016/02/enable-https-cloudfront-certificate-manager-s3/index.html">guide</a>
can be followed. A free SSL certificate was obtained from
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/">AWS Certificate Manager</a>.</p>
